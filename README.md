This study evaluates the effectiveness of three distinct volatility estimation methods—Simple Moving Average (SMA), 
Exponentially Weighted Moving Average (EWMA), and Generalized Auto-Regressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (GARCH)—for Value-at-Risk (VaR) 
estimation and backtesting at 95% and 99% confidence levels. 
Using a Managed Future Fund with an initial asset value of \$10 million, 
invested equally in the second-nearby futures contracts of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil and Henry Hub natural gas, 
the analysis compares the accuracy and reliability of these models in capturing market risks.
